The Uppsala Sofa is everything I hoped for and more! The clean lines fit perfectly with our Scandinavian-inspired living room, and the comfort level is exceptional. The removable covers are a game-changer - our toddler spilled juice on it last week, and it was so easy to remove the cover and wash it. The sofa is firm but not hard, providing great support. Assembly was straightforward and took about 45 minutes with two people.

I've had the Uppsala Sofa for about 6 months now and I'm mostly satisfied. The cushions have maintained their shape well despite daily use, and the fabric quality is excellent. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that the sofa is slightly deeper than I expected (92cm), which makes it a bit awkward for shorter people like me to sit comfortably with feet on the floor. Otherwise, it's a beautiful and well-made piece of furniture.

sofa looks amazing in my apartment, super stylish and i get tons of compliments! but honestly it's not as comfy as i hoped? like it's pretty firm which some people might like but i was wanting something more squishy. the removable covers are clutch though, already had to wash them after a wine spill and they came out perfect. mixed feelings overall but it does look great.

As an interior designer with over 15 years of experience, I can confidently say the Uppsala Sofa represents exceptional value. The frame construction utilizes proper joinery techniques with reinforced corner blocks - details typically found in much more expensive pieces. The cushion density (28kg/m³) provides the perfect balance between support and comfort. The upholstery is a commercial-grade polyester blend (30,000 Martindale rubs) that will withstand years of use. The removable covers feature quality YKK zippers and well-executed pattern matching at the seams. This sofa exemplifies thoughtful design at an accessible price point.

Disappointed with this purchase. While the sofa looks nice, after just two months of normal use, the cushions are already losing their shape and the frame creaks whenever someone sits down. Assembly was also more complicated than advertised, with some parts not fitting together properly. For the price point, I expected much better quality and durability.

The Uppsala Sofa is a great addition to our living room. The fabric is durable and has held up well to our cats' occasional clawing. The cushions are on the firmer side, which I personally prefer for proper back support. Assembly was straightforward though it definitely requires two people. Taking off one star because one of the legs arrived with a small chip, though customer service was quick to send a replacement.

We've had our Uppsala Sofa for over a year now and couldn't be happier! It's the perfect size for our apartment living room, comfortably seating 3-4 people. The cushions have maintained their shape despite daily use, and the removable covers have been washed multiple times with no fading or shrinking. The frame feels incredibly solid - no squeaking or wobbling. Definitely worth the investment!
