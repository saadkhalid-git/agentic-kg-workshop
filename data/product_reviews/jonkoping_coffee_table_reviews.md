The Jönköping Coffee Table is the perfect centerpiece for our living room! The design is sleek yet practical with the lower shelf providing great storage for books and magazines. Assembly was straightforward and took about 30 minutes. The surface is resistant to water rings and scratches - we've been using it daily for 3 months with no signs of wear. The quality far exceeds the price point!

I've had this coffee table for about 2 months and I'm quite pleased with it. The size (110cm x 60cm) is perfect for my apartment living room - not too large but substantial enough to be functional. The construction feels solid and the finish is consistent. Assembly was simple and took about 45 minutes. Taking off one star because the edges are a bit sharper than I'd prefer, but overall it's a quality piece at a reasonable price.

table looks super cute in my space! love the scandinavian vibes and the shelf underneath is perfect for my art books. assembly wasn't too bad, maybe 40 mins? only giving 3 stars because the surface scratches pretty easily - already got a few marks just from setting down my laptop. looks good but definitely need to be careful with it.

As a furniture designer, I appreciate the thoughtful engineering of the Jönköping Coffee Table. The leg attachment mechanism utilizes metal-to-metal fasteners rather than threading directly into the wood, ensuring stability over time. The surface employs a multi-layer finish (I count at least 3 distinct layers) with proper sanding between coats, resulting in exceptional durability. The lower shelf is properly reinforced with a center support that prevents sagging even when loaded with heavy art books. The proportions follow classical design principles with a height-to-width ratio that complements standard sofa heights. This table exemplifies how good design doesn't necessarily require premium pricing.

Disappointed with this purchase. While the table looks nice in photos, the reality is much less impressive. The veneer is extremely thin and already chipping at the corners after just a few weeks. Assembly was straightforward but some of the pre-drilled holes weren't aligned properly. The table also wobbles slightly on my flat floor despite attempts to adjust it. For the price, I expected much better quality.

The Jönköping Coffee Table is a great addition to our living room. The design is simple yet elegant, and it pairs well with our existing furniture. Assembly was very easy - took about 30 minutes total. The table feels sturdy and the lower shelf is handy for storing remote controls and magazines. Taking off one star because the surface shows fingerprints easily and requires frequent cleaning, but otherwise very satisfied with this purchase!

We've had our Jönköping Coffee Table for over a year now and it's held up beautifully through daily use, two kids, and multiple dinner parties where it served as extra seating. The finish has proven remarkably resistant to scratches and water marks. The construction remains solid with no wobbling or loose parts. The design is timeless and we continue to receive compliments from guests. Excellent value for the quality!
