I absolutely love my Stockholm Chair! The minimalist Scandinavian design fits perfectly in my apartment and the ergonomic shape makes it incredibly comfortable for long periods of sitting. Assembly was straightforward and took less than 20 minutes. The materials feel high-quality and durable. Worth every penny!

The Stockholm Chair is exactly what I was looking for aesthetically. Clean lines, beautiful wood finish, and it looks much more expensive than it actually was. I'm taking off one star because the assembly instructions could have been clearer - I had to redo one section when I realized I had attached the back rest upside down. Otherwise, very satisfied with my purchase.

Functional chair with decent build quality. However, after about 3 months of use, I've noticed some squeaking when I lean back. The ergonomic design is good for short periods, but I find it less comfortable for extended work sessions. The aesthetic is nice though, and it was reasonably priced for what you get.

As an interior designer, I'm extremely particular about furniture, and the Stockholm Chair exceeds my expectations. The proportions are perfect, the construction is solid, and the attention to detail is evident in every aspect. The seat height is ideal at 45cm, and the back angle provides excellent lumbar support. The natural wood grain is beautifully highlighted by the finish. This chair exemplifies why Scandinavian design continues to be timeless.

Good chair, good price. Arrived on time and was easy enough to put together. Comfortable to sit in while I'm working from home. Only complaint is that the color is slightly darker than it appeared in the online photos, but it still looks nice in my dining room.

I purchased six of these chairs for my dining table and couldn't be happier! They're sturdy enough to support my husband (who's over 250 lbs) yet elegant looking. The clean lines work perfectly with our mid-century modern decor. Assembly was consistent across all chairs, which I appreciated. They're also surprisingly comfortable for wooden chairs - we've sat through many long dinner parties with no complaints!
