The Linköping Bed has transformed our bedroom! The platform design is sleek and modern, while the hidden storage is incredibly practical in our small apartment. Assembly took about 2 hours with two people, but the instructions were clear and all parts were labeled well. The bed is rock solid - absolutely no squeaking or movement. The slats provide excellent mattress support. Worth every penny!

I've been sleeping on this bed for about 3 months now and I'm quite pleased with it. The construction feels sturdy and the design is elegant without being flashy. The headboard is the perfect height for sitting up and reading. Assembly was straightforward though time-consuming (about 2.5 hours). Taking off one star because some of the edges were a bit sharp and needed sanding, but otherwise very satisfied with this purchase.

bed looks amazing in my room, super stylish and i love the storage drawers! but assembly was a total nightmare, took me and my roommate like 4 hours and we're usually good at this stuff. also the slats make noise sometimes when i move around at night which is annoying. looks great though and the storage is clutch for my small apartment.

As a furniture maker with 20 years of experience, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the Linköping Bed. The frame utilizes proper joinery techniques with reinforced corner blocks and center supports - details typically found in much more expensive pieces. The slat system is properly engineered with the optimal 7cm spacing and appropriate thickness (8mm) to provide ideal mattress support. The storage mechanism uses quality drawer slides rated for 25kg loads. The finish is consistently applied with attention to detail on less visible surfaces - a true mark of quality. This bed represents exceptional value and craftsmanship at this price point.

Disappointed with this purchase. While the bed looks nice, after just two months of use the slats have started to crack and one of the storage drawers no longer opens smoothly. Assembly was also much more complicated than advertised, with some parts not fitting together properly. For the price point, I expected much better quality and durability.

The Linköping Bed is a great addition to our guest room. The design is simple but elegant, and the storage drawers are perfect for extra linens. Assembly took about 2 hours and was straightforward with the included instructions. The bed feels solid and our guests have commented on how comfortable it is. Taking off one star because one of the drawer pulls arrived damaged, though customer service was quick to send a replacement.

We've had our Linköping Bed for over a year now and couldn't be happier! The frame has remained solid with no squeaking or wobbling despite daily use. The storage drawers slide smoothly and hold a surprising amount of items. Our mattress has maintained its shape well thanks to the properly spaced slats. The design is timeless and the finish has held up beautifully. Definitely worth the investment!
