# Helsingborg Dresser Reviews

The Helsingborg Dresser looks nice in my bedroom, but wow, the assembly was a complete nightmare. Took me over 5 hours and I consider myself handy! The instructions were confusing, and many of the pre-drilled holes didn't line up correctly. I had to re-drill several holes myself. The biggest issue is with the drawer rails - they seem poorly manufactured and don't allow the drawers to slide smoothly. They constantly stick and make an annoying scraping sound. For the price, I expected much better quality hardware and easier assembly.

ABSOLUTELY INFURIATING!!! I spent 3 hours trying to assemble this dresser before GIVING UP. The instructions might as well be written in hieroglyphics. The drawer rails were the worst part - they were clearly defective with uneven metal edges and rough sliding mechanisms. When I tried to install them, they wouldn't align properly no matter what I did. Customer service admitted they've had "some issues with a supplier" but offered no solution. The dresser parts are now sitting in my garage waiting for trash day. AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!!

dresser looks ok i guess but assembly was the worst experience ever. took me and my roommate like 6 hours and we still couldn't get the drawers to slide right. the metal rails that the drawers slide on seem totally defective - rough edges, uneven surfaces, and they don't even match each other's dimensions. instructions made no sense and half the screws didn't fit where they were supposed to. ended up having to use random screws i had lying around and file down the rails just to make it somewhat functional. drawers still stick and make this horrible metal-on-metal sound. too exhausted to return it.

Disappointed with this purchase. While the dresser looks nice in photos, the quality of materials is much lower than expected. The drawer rails are clearly defective - they have rough, uneven surfaces that cause the drawers to stick and misalign. Two of the drawers don't close properly no matter how I adjust them, and one drawer already has a crack developing along the bottom from the strain of forcing it open and closed. I contacted customer service who said they're "aware of issues with a recent batch of drawer hardware from their supplier." For the price, I expected much better quality control. Would not recommend.

This dresser should come with a warning label! Assembly instructions were incomprehensible, with tiny diagrams and missing steps. After 4 hours, I realized that several of the panels were warped, making it impossible to assemble correctly. When I called customer service, they told me I'd have to disassemble everything I'd already done and return the entire thing to the store. Complete waste of a Saturday. DO NOT BUY!

I managed to assemble this dresser, but it took nearly 7 hours and a lot of improvisation. The quality is mediocre at best - the back panel is basically cardboard, and the drawer bottoms feel flimsy. One of the drawer handles was scratched right out of the box. It looks okay from a distance, but I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it to anyone else.

I don't understand all these negative reviews about the drawer rails! Yes, the assembly is challenging, but if you carefully follow the instructions and have the right tools, it's completely doable. I noticed the drawer rails seemed a bit rough, so I took 10 minutes to sand them down and apply a tiny bit of lubricant before installing. Took me about 3 hours total, and I'm thrilled with the result. The dresser is sturdy, the drawers now slide perfectly, and it looks beautiful in my bedroom. Maybe I got lucky with my unit or my DIY fix solved the issue, but I think people just need to be patient and detail-oriented during assembly. So satisfied with my purchase while others clearly struggled!
