The Malmö Desk has transformed my home office! The storage solutions are incredibly well-thought-out - I love the cable management system and the drawers are the perfect size for office supplies. Assembly took about 2 hours but the instructions were clear. The desk feels solid and doesn't wobble at all. The clean design fits perfectly with my minimalist aesthetic.

I've been using this desk for my work-from-home setup for about 3 months now. The surface area (140cm x 65cm) is perfect for my dual monitor setup with room to spare. The drawer slides are smooth and the cable management keeps everything tidy. Taking off one star because the edges of the desk are a bit sharp - I had to add some edge protectors to avoid scratching myself.

decent desk, looks nice in my apartment. the storage is helpful but honestly i expected more drawers based on the description. assembly was pretty complicated, took me like 3 hours and i'm usually good at this stuff. it's stable though and the right height for me (i'm tall). probably wouldn't buy again but it works for now.

As a professional architect who works from home, I require a workspace that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The Malmö Desk exceeds expectations on both fronts. The work surface maintains perfect flatness under the weight of my drafting equipment. The storage compartments are intelligently designed with dimensions that accommodate standard paper sizes and supplies. The cable management system is particularly ingenious, with rubber grommets that prevent cable fraying. Construction is solid with proper joinery techniques evident throughout. This desk represents exceptional value for the quality provided.

Disappointed with this purchase. The desk looks nice in photos but in person the finish has inconsistencies and there were several scratches right out of the box. Assembly was frustrating because some of the pre-drilled holes didn't align properly. Now that it's built, it's functional but I notice it wobbles slightly when I'm typing. For the price, I expected much better quality.

Great desk for the price! I'm a college student and this fits perfectly in my apartment. The storage is adequate for my needs and the design is simple but attractive. Assembly took about 90 minutes by myself. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that the drawer doesn't open as smoothly as I'd like. Otherwise, very satisfied with this purchase!

This desk has been a game-changer for my small home office. The dimensions are perfect - not too bulky but plenty of workspace. The storage solutions are cleverly designed and keep everything I need within reach. Assembly was straightforward with the included instructions. The materials feel high-quality and the desk is rock solid with no wobbling. Highly recommend!
