This table is the centerpiece of our dining room! The modern design is stunning yet timeless, and the quality is exceptional. We've had it for 6 months now and it still looks brand new despite daily use with two kids. Assembly took about an hour with two people. The surface is easy to clean and surprisingly resistant to scratches. Highly recommend!

The Gothenburg Table looks beautiful, I'll give it that. But assembly was a nightmare - some of the pre-drilled holes didn't line up properly and I had to drill new ones. Once assembled, it's sturdy enough, but I expected better quality control for this price point. The table top also shows fingerprints very easily which is annoying for daily use.

As someone who entertains frequently, I needed a table that was both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The Gothenburg Table delivers on both counts. The dimensions (180cm x 90cm) are perfect for seating 6-8 people comfortably. The solid wood construction gives it a substantial feel, and the joinery is impeccable. The finish has a subtle matte quality that highlights the natural grain patterns. Assembly was straightforward with clear instructions. This table will clearly last for decades.

Disappointed with this purchase. The table arrived with a small dent on one edge, and while customer service was helpful in sending a replacement part, it was a hassle to deal with. The table also wobbles slightly on my hardwood floor despite multiple attempts to adjust it. For the price, I expected better quality control.

Perfect table for our family of four! We've been using it daily for meals, homework, and game nights for the past year. It's held up beautifully with no signs of wear. The surface cleans easily and has resisted stains from art projects and spilled drinks. Assembly was straightforward and the included tools were adequate. The design is simple yet elegant - exactly what we wanted.

Good quality table that looks more expensive than it is. Assembly was straightforward but definitely needs two people. The wood grain is beautiful and the finish is smooth. I'm taking off one star because it scratches a bit more easily than I'd like, but overall I'm happy with the purchase.
