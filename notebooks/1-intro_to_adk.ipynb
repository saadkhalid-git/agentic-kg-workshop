    "    - then another used to handle farewells\n",
    "2. Designating a **root agent** (or orchestrator or coordinator) that receives the initial user request.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**Why build an Agent Team?**\n",

    "* **Modularity:** Easier to develop, test, and maintain individual agents.  \n",

    "* **Scalability:** Simpler to add new capabilities by adding new agents.  \n",
    "* **Efficiency:** Allows using potentially simpler/cheaper models for simpler tasks (like greetings).\n",
    "\n",
    "**To illustrate this, you will:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define another simple tool that will handle farewells (`say_goodbye`).  \n",
    "2. Create two new specialized sub-agents: `greeting_agent` and `farewell_agent`.  \n",
    "3. Create a new top-level agent (`cypher_agent_team`) to act as the **root agent**.  \n",

    "\n",
    "So far, our agent team can handle different tasks through delegation, but each interaction starts fresh â€“ the agents have no memory of past conversations or user preferences within a session. To create more sophisticated and context-aware experiences, agents need **memory**. ADK provides this through **Session State**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Session State?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's a Python dictionary (`session.state`) tied to a specific user session (identified by `APP_NAME`, `USER_ID`, `SESSION_ID`).  \n",
    "* It persists information *across multiple conversational turns* within that session.  \n",
    "* Agents and Tools can read from and write to this state, allowing them to remember details, adapt behavior, and personalize responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Agents Interact with State:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`ToolContext` (Primary Method):** Tools can accept a `ToolContext` object (automatically provided by ADK if declared as the last argument). This object gives direct access to the session state via `tool_context.state`, allowing tools to read preferences or save results *during* execution.  \n",
    "2. **`output_key` (Auto-Save Agent Response):** An `Agent` can be configured with an `output_key=\"your_key\"`. ADK will then automatically save the agent's final textual response for a turn into `session.state[\"your_key\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this step, we will enhance our Cypher team by:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using a **new** `InMemorySessionService` to demonstrate state in isolation.  \n",
    "2. Initializing session state with a default user name.  \n",
    "3. Creating a state-aware version of the say_hello tool (`say_hello_stateful`) which responds with a personalized greeting and sets the user name in the session state.  \n",
    "4. Creating a state-aware version of the say_goodbye tool (`say_goodbye_stateful`) that reads this preference via `ToolContext` and adjusts a personalized goodbye message.  \n",
    "5. Running a conversation to observe how the initial state affects the tool, how manual state changes alter subsequent behavior."
