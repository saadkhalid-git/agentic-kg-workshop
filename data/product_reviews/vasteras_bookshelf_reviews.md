The Västerås Bookshelf is exactly what I was looking for! The modular design allowed me to configure it perfectly for my space. Assembly was straightforward and took about 90 minutes. The shelves are sturdy enough to hold my extensive book collection without any sagging. The clean lines and quality finish make it look much more expensive than it actually was. Highly recommend!

I purchased two Västerås Bookshelves for my home office and I'm quite pleased with them. The assembly instructions were clear, though it did take longer than expected (about 2 hours per unit). Each shelf holds approximately 30-35 hardcover books without any sign of bending. The finish is consistent and the overall construction feels solid. Taking off one star because some of the pre-drilled holes weren't perfectly aligned, which made assembly a bit frustrating at times.

looks great in my apartment but was a pain to put together tbh. instructions were confusing and i had to redo some steps. once it was built though it's pretty nice, holds all my books and plants and looks stylish. just wish it wasn't so complicated to assemble. probably wouldn't buy again but it works for what i need.

As a librarian with an extensive home collection, I've purchased many bookshelves over the years, and the Västerås stands out for its exceptional quality-to-price ratio. The shelf depth of 30cm accommodates larger art books that typically protrude on standard shelves. The vertical supports utilize a proper mortise and tenon construction rather than the cam-lock fasteners common at this price point. The load capacity is impressive - I've tested each shelf with approximately 20kg of books with no deflection. The finish is consistent with no visible brush marks or uneven application. Assembly was logical and the included instructions were precise, with properly numbered components and hardware sorted by step.

Disappointed with this purchase. While the bookshelf looks nice in photos, the quality of materials is lower than expected. The veneer is extremely thin and chipped in several places during assembly. Speaking of assembly, it was a nightmare - took over 3 hours and some of the parts didn't fit together properly. Now that it's built, it wobbles slightly and I don't trust putting anything heavy on the upper shelves.

Good bookshelf for the price! I needed something to display both books and decorative items, and this works perfectly. Assembly was straightforward though time-consuming (about 2 hours). The shelves are adjustable which is a nice feature I've already taken advantage of. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that the back panel is quite thin and feels a bit flimsy compared to the rest of the unit. Otherwise, very satisfied!

We've had our Västerås Bookshelf for over a year now and it's held up beautifully! The construction is solid and there's been no sagging despite heavy use. The design is timeless and blends well with both our modern and antique pieces. Assembly was straightforward with clear instructions. The adjustable shelves have been a great feature as our needs have changed. Excellent value for the quality!
