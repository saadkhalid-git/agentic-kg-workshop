The Norrköping Nightstand is the perfect bedside companion! The drawer is spacious enough for books, reading glasses, and other essentials, while the open shelf below is great for displaying decorative items. Assembly was incredibly simple - took less than 20 minutes. The construction feels solid and the drawer slides smoothly. The compact size (45cm x 40cm) fits perfectly in my small bedroom without overwhelming the space.

I purchased two of these nightstands for our master bedroom and I'm quite pleased with them. The design is simple yet elegant, and they pair well with our existing furniture. Assembly was straightforward and took about 30 minutes per unit. The drawer operates smoothly and the finish is consistent. Taking off one star because the back panel is a bit thin, but overall these are quality pieces at a reasonable price.

nightstand looks cute next to my bed! perfect height and i love the little drawer for my stuff. assembly was super easy, like 15 mins tops. only giving 3 stars because the drawer sometimes sticks when i open it too fast and the wood feels kinda lightweight. looks nice though and does the job for now.

As a furniture restorer specializing in small case goods, I'm impressed with the construction quality of the Norrköping Nightstand. The drawer employs proper dovetail joinery rather than the stapled construction common at this price point. The drawer slide mechanism utilizes a self-closing feature with dampened action - a premium detail unexpected in this category. The case construction uses proper mortise and tenon joints at stress points rather than relying solely on fasteners. The finish is consistently applied with attention to detail on less visible surfaces - a true mark of quality. The dimensions (45cm height) are ergonomically optimal for standard bed heights. This nightstand represents exceptional value and craftsmanship.

Disappointed with this purchase. While the nightstand looks nice in photos, the quality of materials is lower than expected. The drawer doesn't close properly - it always leaves a small gap. Assembly was simple enough but the pre-drilled holes for the drawer handle weren't aligned correctly. The nightstand also scratches very easily - I already have several marks just from normal use. For the price, I expected better quality.

The Norrköping Nightstand is a great addition to my guest bedroom. The size is perfect and the design is clean and simple. Assembly was very easy and took about 25 minutes. The drawer slides smoothly and the open shelf is handy for books. Taking off one star because one corner arrived slightly damaged, though it's not very noticeable against the wall. Otherwise, very satisfied with this purchase!

We've had our Norrköping Nightstands for over a year now and they've held up beautifully! The drawers still slide perfectly and show no signs of sagging despite daily use. The finish has maintained its appearance with no scratches or wear marks. The design is timeless and blends well with various decor styles. These nightstands offer excellent quality for the price!
