The Örebro Lamp is a stunning addition to my living room! The design is both modern and timeless, providing the perfect ambient lighting for evening relaxation. Assembly was incredibly simple - took less than 10 minutes. The materials feel high-quality and the dimmer function is smooth and responsive. The shade diffuses light beautifully without any harsh spots. Highly recommend!

I purchased this lamp for my home office and it's been a great addition. The light output is perfect for task lighting - bright enough to work by but not harsh or glaring. The adjustable arm is sturdy and stays in position. Assembly was straightforward with clear instructions. Taking off one star because the cord is a bit short (only 1.5m) which limited my placement options, but otherwise very satisfied.

lamp looks super cute in my bedroom! gives off nice vibes and the dimmer is perfect for creating mood lighting. assembly was easy peasy. only giving 3 stars because the switch feels kinda cheap and i'm worried it might break eventually. also the base is lighter than i expected so it tips over easily if you bump it. looks good though!

As an electrical engineer with a passion for lighting design, I'm thoroughly impressed with the Örebro Lamp. The LED driver utilizes a constant current design that eliminates flickering even at the lowest dimmer settings - a detail often overlooked in consumer lighting. The color temperature (3000K) provides a perfect warm white that renders colors accurately with a CRI of approximately 90+. The shade material has precisely calculated opacity to diffuse light evenly while still allowing directional control. The weighted base (3.2kg) ensures stability while the minimal footprint (22cm diameter) conserves space efficiently. The power consumption is remarkably efficient at only 12W while providing illuminance equivalent to a traditional 75W incandescent.

Disappointed with this purchase. While the lamp looks nice in photos, the reality is much less impressive. The materials feel cheap, particularly the shade which is unevenly colored. The dimmer switch is finicky and sometimes flickers at lower settings. Assembly was easy enough but the lamp wobbles slightly on its base. For the price point, I expected much better quality.

Good lamp for the price! The design is elegant and it provides nice ambient lighting in my reading nook. Assembly was very simple - just attach the shade to the base. The dimmer function works well though it's a bit stiff to turn. Taking off one star because the shade arrived with a small dent, though customer service was helpful and offered a partial refund since I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it.

We've had our Örebro Lamp for about 6 months now and love it! The light quality is excellent - warm without being yellow, and bright enough to read by but not harsh. The design is simple yet distinctive and we've received many compliments from guests. The dimmer function has been reliable and smooth. The lamp feels sturdy and well-made - definitely worth the investment!
